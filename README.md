# unsupervised-machine-learning-challenge

### In this repository I take a look at a few unsupervised machine learning models. I run a PCA reduction on a dataset that looks at myopia for a medical research company. 

### I also look at KMeans and use an elbow plot to determine the best number of clusters for a KMeans model.
